	  /*==============================================\
	  | C++ implementation of the hackermann fonction |
	  \==============================================*/

/* metaprogramming */
/* --------------- */

	- `ackermann-meta.hcc'

/* the usual way */
/* ------------- */

	- `ackermann-naive.cc'
	- `ackermann-naive.hh'


.-------------------------------------.
| Ackermann fonction has 2 parameters |
`-------------------------------------'

in order to build binaries computing `Ackermann(3, 2)', just type :

$ make M=3 N=2

There's also an interactive rule:

$ make ask



for each case, it creates :
- a binary `acker-%M-%N-meta'
- `acker-%M-%N-meta.out' which the result of the execution
- `acker-%M-%N-meta.stats' which contains statistics about compilation
of the metaprog code.
- `acker-%M-%N-naive.stats which contains statictics about execution of the
naive version.
